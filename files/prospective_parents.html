      <ul class = "vision_list">

      <li>Upon acceptance, a <b>nonrefundable deposit of one
        monthâ€™s tuition</b> is due. This will be applied to tuition for the
        following May.</li>
        <li>Upon acceptance, the <b><a class="download" href="files/developmental.html" target="_blank">Developmental History Form</a></b> and <a class="download" href="files/application.html" target="_blank">Medical Forms</a> are due.</li>
        <li><b>ORIENTATION</b>: This visiting day is usually the day after Labor Day and gives the child and parent(s) an opportunity to visit the classroom and meet the teachers and classmates. This visit is one hour. It will allow time for the child to enjoy free play and also gives parent(s) a brief overview of what to expect during the school year.
          The next day, a child will attend school on his/her own (either Wednesday or Thursday, see orientation schedule). The class is divided in half, attending on either Wednesday or Thursday. This schedule allows the children and teachers to interact with a small group before the entire class attends on Friday.
