                Enrichment one time per month. We will introduce an Element of Art
                each month and build understanding through conversations and
                experiences in the Art Studio, that may be displayed and later sent
                home with a description of your child’s introduction to that Element
                of Art.

                I have had the privilege and honor of teaching Art Enrichment at WUNS
                since 2002. It is a great joy to share my knowledge and passion for
                the Visual Arts with the children! Each and every year I am reminded
                and continually astounded at the beauty, simplicity and sincerity of
                each young Artist’s understandings and renderings of Art from their
                personal perspective. Thank you for sharing your Preschooler with me!"
