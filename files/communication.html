          <h1>Parent-Teacher Conferences</h1>
          <p>
            Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring). Teachers take note of students’ activities throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The Fall conference is informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child, and answer any questions they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences. The Spring conference is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment form covering all areas of the curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.
