          We accept registrations on a first-come basis, with preference to
          children enrolled in the school year.

        <p>
          Designed for children ages 2 1/2 to 5 years, our summer
          camp program includes a wide range of creative indoor and outdoor
          activities, with time to explore and discover, play and make
          friends. Since a good number of hours are spent outside during
          summer camp, the nursery school playground provides opportunities to
          cool off with outdoor water play that includes troughs, sprinklers
          and hoses. Building in the sand and playing on the climbing
          equipment are two other favorite outdoor activities. An adjoining
          wading pool is available for summer campers, whether enrolled in the
          swimming classes or not. Children bring their own lunches. Camp
          provides a morning snack.

        3-Bears Camp is located in the Washington University Nursery School
        facility on the Washington University campus. It is composed of three
        classrooms and an all-purpose room, which are designed to offer
        children a variety of choices in their play. Our large outdoor play
        area gives children the opportunity to run, bike, swing, climb, slide,
        and play in the sand and water.
      </p>
      <p>
        Children may take advantage of swimming lessons offered as an optional
        program during each session. There will be eight lessons per session,
        at a cost of $65. Children must be toilet trained to participate in
        swimming lessons. The swimming pool is located adjacent to the Nursery
        School.
